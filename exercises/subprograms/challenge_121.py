"""
Create a program that will allow the user to easily manage a list of names.
You should display a menu that will allow them to add a name to the list,
change a name in the list, delete a name from the list or view all the names
in the list.
There should also be a menu option to allow the user to end the program.
If they select an option that is not relevant, then it should display a suitable
message. After they have made a selection to either add a name, change a name,
delete a name or view all the names, they should see the menu again without having
to restart the program. The program should be made as easy to use as possible.
